# Penguin MVC

**MVC design pattern study**

## Features

* ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)
* Unit testing without browser(Tape)
* Component factories
* Vanilla javascript
* Gulp
* Browserify


## Motivation

After reading the very good article, designing the MVC pattern in Vanilla JavaScript by **Camilo Reyes**, published in **Sitepoint**, I decided to implement this pattern doing an exercise with a more functional approach.

I knew this pattern before, but it's a good idea to study it again, to refresh concepts and learn new things in the process.
